# Code of Conduct  

## Our Pledge  

We, as contributors, maintainers, and members of this community, pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We commit to acting in ways that foster an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards  

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive community include:

Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others
Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
Providing and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
Taking responsibility for mistakes, apologizing, and learning from the experience
Focusing on what is best for the community, not just for ourselves as individuals
Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
Trolling, insulting, derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
Public or private harassment
Publishing others’ private information (e.g., physical or email address) without explicit permission
Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting  

## Our Responsibilities  

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to:

Remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct
Temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful  

## Scope  

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including the GitHub repository, community chat, and events. It also applies when an individual is representing the project or community in public spaces.
Examples of representation include:

Using an official project email address
Posting via an official social media account
Acting as a designated representative at online or offline events
Behavior outside project spaces may also be addressed if it negatively impacts the project or community.

## Enforcement  

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior can be reported by contacting the project team at [conduct@yourproject.com]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

The project team is committed to maintaining confidentiality regarding the reporter of an incident.

Maintainers who fail to enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent consequences as determined by the project’s leadership.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.
